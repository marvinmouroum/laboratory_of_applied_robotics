Contains Datatypes for planning and constructing 2D paths.  


\subsection*{Namespaces}
\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
 \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_path2_d_1_1_element}{Element}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Contains basic elements needed for describing a path. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
\subsection*{Classes}
\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_path2_d_1_1_dubin_path_finder}{Dubin\+Path\+Finder}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Class that given the path coordinates allow to find the path using the dubins path algorithm. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_path2_d_1_1_path}{Path}}
\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_path2_d_1_1_path_finder}{Path\+Finder}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em abstract class for finding a path between two Positions  This class is a basis for more defined classes based on this class structure. For example a Dubins\+Path\+Finder class could be used to find a path using Dubin\+Curves, or an Spline\+Path\+Finder could be made to find a Spline\+Curve. Anyway this class does not just contain the basic structure of future specialized implementations but also usefull tools every Path\+Finding algorithm needs, such as a collision detection class nested inside. Given a map object this class can be used to see if the picked path is colliding with obstacles in the map. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
