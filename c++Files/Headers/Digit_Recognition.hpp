/**
 \brief The Digit_Recognition class is used to detect digits in the arena and export PeopleData.
 
 \discussion The Digit_Recognition class is used to detect digits in the arena and export PeopleData.
 The class contains a Character_Recognition_Algorithm member that is used to detect digits. Changing the DigitRecognitionAlgo type results in the use of another implementation of Character_Recognition_Algorithm derived classes.
 New types of Character_Recognition_Algorithm subclasses can be added to improve digit recognition performance over time.
 The class contains HSVFilterRange object that is able to automatically construct a color filter from a given input image.
 When detect_digit_for_map is called the class will identify circles, use the filter to extract the digits, perform the digit recognition and export a PeopleData object that can be used to create People objects and feed the map.
