 \brief abstract class for finding a path between two Positions
 \discussion This class is a basis for more defined classes based on this class structure. For example a DubinsPathFinder class could be used to find a path using DubinCurves, or an SplinePathFinder could be made to find a SplineCurve. Anyway this class does not just contain the basic structure of future specialized implementations but also usefull tools every PathFinding algorithm needs, such as a collision detection class nested inside. Given a map object this class can be used to see if the picked path is colliding with obstacles in the map.
