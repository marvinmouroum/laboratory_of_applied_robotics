# laboratory_of_applied_robotics

## Summary

During this project a lego mindstorm robot was used to autonomously drive out of a mace in the shortest time possible while simultanously collecting items along the way. A camera was fixed at the ceiling and one still image was taken to detect the map and the robot. Afterwards a route was planed and sent to the robot, which executed the commands.

The project was split into the following parts:
- Camera calibration
- Object detection
- Route Planning
- Execution
