\subsection{Detailed Description}
class for representing people in the map that have to be collected 

\mbox{\hyperlink{class_people}{People}} are round objects with green background that need to be collected before exiting the map. \mbox{\hyperlink{class_people}{People}} have a unique identifier given by a digit. This identifier is their name. \mbox{\hyperlink{class_people}{People}} inherit all shape characteristics of Circles, because their have circular shapes. In addition to their name and form people have a confidence level assigned to them indicating how confident the character recognition algorithm was when detecting their name.
